    "Rounding errors come up in many places. One example is with currency. We express currency in the United States as dollars and cents. What happens when a transaction needs to take place that yields an amount with more than two decimal places? Should we use typical rounding rules and round it to the nearest cent? Or, should we truncate, or drop, all the remaining digits until we only have two decimal places?\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "In a penny-shaving scheme, we could use truncation to round and keep the truncated amount. For example, if the transaction had a value `$631.954`, we would truncate it to `$631.95` and keep for ourselves the `$0.004`. Such a small amount would be impercetible as a single transaction, but if we could process millions of transactions in such a way, it would quickly add up.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1980s, a new stock index at the Vancouver Stock Exchange tracked a mysterious loss in value. After an investigation, it was revealed that the loss in value of the index was due to a rounding error where the calculations were done with truncation instead of rounding transactions to the nearest two decimal places. This mistake resulted in almost a 50% loss in value over 22 months. \n",
