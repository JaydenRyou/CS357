## Numerical Method 1

Numerical methods are becoming increasingly essential in various fields, including engineering and physical sciences. Previously, testing the efficiency of a new aircraft design involved building and flying a costly physical prototype. However, with the advancement of technology, aerospace engineers can now use accurate simulations on their laptops to carry out such tests.

This course provides an introduction to the fundamentals of scientific computing and numerical methods. Theoretical algorithms will be taught alongside practical programming exercises. It is essential to ensure the accuracy and reliability of numerical simulations. Thus, this course will focus on understanding the errors that occur in scientific computing, particularly in representing real numbers with finite memory through floating-point numbers. Understanding these errors is equally vital as comprehending the algorithms themselves.
